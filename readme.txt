Provides a task management system.

== Description ==

<h4>Handle Massive Number of Actions</h4>
Do you have specific tasks which need to run at your desired time? Do you use WordPress as a proxy to generate data from external sources? As WordPress has evolved into a phase of application platforms, a more enhanced task management system needed to emerge.

Currently, with WP Cron, if you register a large number of actions, for example, 1000 tasks to run immediately and one of them stalls, it affects all the other actions preventing them from being loaded at the scheduled time. Also, the scheduled tasks won't be triggered if there is no visitor on the site. The goal of this plugin is to resolve such issues and become the perfect solution for WordPress powered back-end application servers to provide full-brown API functionalities.

<h4>What it does</h4>
- (optional) creates periodic background access to the site. 
- triggers tasks registered by the site owner at desired time or interval.

<h4>Built-in Actions</h4>
- <strong>Delete Posts</strong> - performs bulk deletion of posts based on the post type, post statuses, taxonomy, and taxonomy terms.
- <strong>Send Email</strong> - sends email to specified email addresses.
- <strong>Clean Transients</strong> - deletes expired transients (caches).
- <strong>Check Web Sites</strong> - accesses specified web pages and checks certain keywords.
- <strong>Run PHP Scripts</strong> - runs PHP scripts of your choosing.

<h4>Custom Action Modules</h4>
- <strong>[Auto Post](https://wordpress.org/plugins/auto-post/)</strong> - creates posts automatically.

<h4>Extensible</h4>
This is designed to be fully extensible and developers can add custom modules including actions and occurrence types.

== Installation ==

= Install = 

1. Upload **`task-scheduler.php`** and other files compressed in the zip folder to the **`/wp-content/plugins/`** directory.,
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.

= How to Use =  
1. Define a `Task` via **Dashboard** -> **Task Scheduler** -> **Add New Task**
2. In the task listing table, toggle on and off.

== Other Notes ==

<h4>Create a Custom Action</h4>
You can run your custom action with Task Scheduler and run it at scheduled times, once a day, with a fixed interval, or whatever you set with the plugin.

Place the code that includes the module in your plugin or `functions.php` of the activated theme.

**1.** Decide your action slug which also serves as a WordPress _filter_ hook.

Say, you pick `my_custom_action` as an action name.

**2.** Use the `add_filter()` WordPress core function to hook into the action.

`
/**
 * Called when the Task Scheduler plugin gets loaded.
 */
function doMyCustomAction( $isExitCode, $oRoutine ) {
    
    /**
     * Do you stuff here.
     */
    TaskScheduler_Debug::log( $oRoutine->getMeta() );
    return 1;
    
}
/**
 * Set the 'my_custom_action' custom action slug in the Select Action screen
 * via Dashboard -> Task Scheduler -> Add New Task.
 */
add_filter( 'my_custom_action', 'doMyCustomAction', 10, 2 );
`

Please note that we use `add_filter()` not `add_action()` in order to return an exit code. 

Return `1` if the task completes and `0` when there is a problem. You can pass any value except `null`.

**3.** Go to **Dashboard** -> **Task Scheduler** -> **Add New Task**. Proceed with the wizard and when you get the **Select Action** screen after setting up the occurrence, type **my_custom_action**, the one you defined in the above step.
  
The action slug set in the field will be triggered at the scheduled time.

It will be easier for you to modify an [existent code](https://gist.github.com/michaeluno/5819636448947e7ab733). You can download the zip file and install it on your site.

<h4>Create a Custom Action Module</h4>
If you want your action to be listed in the **Select Action** screen, you need to create an action module. 

To create an action module, you need to define a class by extending a base class that Task Scheduler prepares for you.

**1.** Define your custom action module class by extending the `TaskScheduler_Action_Base` class.

`
class TaskScheduler_SampleActionModule extends TaskScheduler_Action_Base {
        
    /**
     * The user constructor.
     * 
     * This method is automatically called at the end of the class constructor.
     */
    public function construct() {}

    /**
     * Returns the readable label of this action.
     * 
     * This will be called when displaying the action in an pull-down select option, task listing table, or notification email message.
     */
    public function getLabel( $sLabel ) {         
        return __( 'Sample Action Module', 'task-scheduler-sample-action-module' );
    }
    
    /**
     * Returns the description of the module.
     */
    public function getDescription( $sDescription ) {
        return __( 'This is a sample action module.', 'task-scheduler-sample-action-module' );
    }    
    
    /**
     * Defines the behaviour of the task action.
     *  
     */
    public function doAction( $isExitCode, $oRoutine ) {
        
        /**
         * Write your own code here! Delete the below log method. 
         * 
         * Good luck!
         */
        TaskScheduler_Debug::log( $oRoutine->getMeta() );
        
        // Exit code.
        return 1;
        
    }
            
}
`

In the `doAction()` method of the above class, define the behaviour of your action what it does. The second parameter receives a routine object. The object has a public method named `getMeta()` which returns the associated arguments. 

**2.** Use the `task_scheduler_action_after_loading_plugin` action hook to register your action module.

To register your action module, just instantiate the class you defined.

`
function loadTaskSchedulerSampleActionModule() {
    
    // Register a custom action module.
    include( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/module/TaskScheduler_SampleActionModule.php' );
    new TaskScheduler_SampleActionModule;
    
}
add_action( 'task_scheduler_action_after_loading_plugin', 'loadTaskSchedulerSampleActionModule' );
`

**3.** Go to **Dashboard** -> **Task Scheduler** -> **Add New Task**. Proceed the wizard and when you get the **Select Action** screen, choose your action.

You can set your custom arguments in the **Argument (optional)** field if necessary.

The set values will be stored in the argument element of the array returned by the `getMeta()` public method of the routine object.

It will be easier for you to modify an existent module. Get an example action module which comes as a plugin from [this page](https://github.com/michaeluno/task-scheduler-sample-action-module). Download and activate it on your test site. Then modify the code, especially the `doAction()` method which defines the behavior of the action.

<h4>Create Threads</h4>
When your routine is too heavy and gets hung often, you can create threads that performs sub-routines of the main routine.

**1.** Define your thread class the `TaskScheduler_Action_Base` class.
`
class TaskScheduler_SampleActionModule_Thread extends TaskScheduler_Action_Base {

    /**
     * Returns the readable label of this action.
     *
     * This will be called when displaying the action in an pull-down select option, task listing table, or notification email message.
     */
    public function getLabel( $sLabel ) {
        return __( 'Run a PHP Script', 'task-scheduler' );
    }

    /**
     * Defines the behavior of the task action.
     */
    public function doAction( $isExitCode, $oThread ) {

        // Do your stuff
        $_aThreadArguments = $oThread->getMeta();
        TaskScheduler_Debug::log( $_aThreadArguments );
        return 1;

    }
}
`

**2.** Instantiate the thread class.

In the `construct()` method of your action module class introduced above that calls threads, instantiate the thread class by passing a custom action name. Here we pass `task_scheduler_my_thread` as an example.

`
class TaskScheduler_SampleActionModule extends TaskScheduler_Action_Base {

    public function construct() {
        new TaskScheduler_SampleActionModule_Thread( 'task_scheduler_my_thread' );
    }

    ...

}
`

**3.** Create a thread.

In the `doAction()` method of your action module class, create a thread with the `createThread()` method. The parameters are:

`createThread( $sThreadActionHookName, $oRoutine, array $aThreadOptions, array $aSystemTaxonomyTerms=array(), $bAllowDuplicate )`
    1. `$sThreadActionHookName` - (string, required) the slug that serves as an action hook name
    2. `$oRoutine` - (object, required) the routine object that is passed to the second parameter of `doAction()`` method.
    3. `$aThreadOptions` - (array, required) an associative array holding arguments to pass to the thread.
    4. `$aSystemTaxonomyTerms` - (array, optional) an array holding taxonomy terms for the system the plugin provides. Default: `array()``.
    5. `$bAllowDuplicate` - (boolean, optional) whether to allow threads to be created with same arguments. Default: `false`.

Make sure the return value is `null` so that the routine will not close. Here we assume the `$_aData` variable holds lots of items so it must be processed separately by threads.

`
class TaskScheduler_SampleActionModule extends TaskScheduler_Action_Base {
    ...
    public function doAction( $isExitCode, $oRoutine ) {

        // Assuming this is big.
        $_aData = array(
            array(  'a', 'b', 'c' ),
            array(  'd', 'e', 'f', 'g' ),
            array(  'h', 'i' ),
        );

        foreach( $_aData as $_aDatum ) {
            $_aArguments = array(
                'datum' => $_aDatum,
                'foo'   => 'bar',
            );
            $this->createThread( 'task_scheduler_my_thread', $oRoutine, $_aArguments );
        }

        // Do not close this routine by returning `null`. When all the threads are done, this routine will be automatically closed.
        return null;

    }
    ...
}
`

**4.** Process Passed Data from a Routine to a Thread.
In the thread class, retrieve the passed data.

`
class TaskScheduler_SampleActionModule_Thread extends TaskScheduler_Action_Base {

    ...

    /**
     * Defines the behavior of the task action.
     */
    public function doAction( $isExitCode, $oThread ) {

        // Do your stuff
        $_aArguments = $oThread->getMeta();
        $_sFoo       = $_aArguments[ 'foo' ];  // is `bar`
        $_aDatum     =  $_aArguments[ 'datum' ]; // is either array(  'a', 'b', 'c' ), array(  'd', 'e', 'f', 'g' ), or array(  'h', 'i' )

        TaskScheduler_Debug::log( $_aArguments );
        return 1;

    }

}
`

The entire code will look like this.

Action Module Class:
`
class TaskScheduler_SampleActionModule extends TaskScheduler_Action_Base {

    /**
     * The user constructor.
     *
     * This method is automatically called at the end of the class constructor.
     */
    public function construct() {
        new TaskScheduler_SampleActionModule_Thread( 'task_scheduler_my_thread' );
    }


    /**
     * Returns the readable label of this action.
     *
     * This will be called when displaying the action in an pull-down select option, task listing table, or notification email message.
     */
    public function getLabel( $sLabel ) {
        return __( 'Sample Action Module', 'task-scheduler-sample-action-module' );
    }

    /**
     * Returns the description of the module.
     */
    public function getDescription( $sDescription ) {
        return __( 'This is a sample action module.', 'task-scheduler-sample-action-module' );
    }

    public function doAction( $isExitCode, $oRoutine ) {

        // Assuming this is big.
        $_aData = array(
            array(  'a', 'b', 'c' ),
            array(  'd', 'e', 'f', 'g' ),
            array(  'h', 'i' ),
        );

        foreach( $_aData as $_aDatum ) {
            $_aArguments = array(
                'datum' => $_aDatum,
                'foo'   => 'bar',
            );
            $this->createThread( 'task_scheduler_my_thread', $oRoutine, $_aArguments );
        }

        // Do not close this routine by returning `null`. When all the threads are done, this routine will be automatically closed.
        return null;

    }

}
`
Thread Class:
`
class TaskScheduler_SampleActionModule_Thread extends TaskScheduler_Action_Base {

    /**
     * Returns the readable label of this action.
     *
     * This will be called when displaying the action in an pull-down select option, task listing table, or notification email message.
     */
    public function getLabel( $sLabel ) {
        return __( 'Run a PHP Script', 'task-scheduler' );
    }

    /**
     * Defines the behavior of the task action.
     */
    public function doAction( $isExitCode, $oThread ) {

        // Do your stuff
        $_aArguments = $oThread->getMeta();
        $_sFoo       = $_aArguments[ 'foo' ];  // is `bar`
        $_aDatum     =  $_aArguments[ 'datum' ]; // is either array(  'a', 'b', 'c' ), array(  'd', 'e', 'f', 'g' ), or array(  'h', 'i' )

        TaskScheduler_Debug::log( $_aArguments );
        return 1;

    }

}
`

Don't forget to instantiate the action module class.

`
new TaskScheduler_SampleActionModule;
`


<h4>Terminologies</h4>

- **Task** - a rule which defines what kind of action routine to be performed at a specified time.
- **Routine** - a main action routine created by a task. Depending on the action, it creates an action thread to divide its routine.
- **Thread** - a divided action sub-sequential routine created by a routine. For example, The email action creates threads and sends emails per thread instead of sending them all in one routine to avoid exceeding the PHP's maximum execution time.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who needs this? =
This is mostly for site admins who need total control over the server behavior. If you use WordPress just to publish articles, you won't need this.

= Is it possible to trigger actions while disabling the server heartbeat? =
Yes. In that case, you need to set up your own Cron job that accesses the site with the `task_scheduler_checking_actions` query string in the request url.

e.g.
`/usr/local/bin/curl --silent http://your-site/?task_scheduler_checking_actions=1`

`/usr/local/bin/wget http://your-site/?task_scheduler_checking_actions=1`

= Is it possible to send an email when a particular task completes? =
Yes. Create a task with the `Exit Code` occurrence type and the `Send Email` action. The `Exit Code` occurrence type lets you choose which task and what exit code should trigger an email to be sent.

= Is it possible to execute a PHP script? = 
The `PHP Script` action module lets you run PHP scripts located on your server. One thing to keep in mind is that the plugin just includes the PHP file using `include()` so it does not technically execute a PHP script. 

= How can I know what exit code is returned from an action? =
The most built-in actions return `1` when they succeed and `0` on failure. You can check what exit code will be returned by enabling the log. 

To enable the log, go to **Dashboard** -> **Task Scheduler** -> **Manage Tasks** and click on the **Edit** link of the task. Set a number in the **Max Count of Log Entries** option. `50` would be sufficient to check exit codes.

After the task runs, click on the **View** link of the task listing table of the task. The log page will open and it should tell what exit code the action returns.

= How can I create a module? =
See the [Other Notes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/task-scheduler/other_notes/) section. It requires a basic PHP coding skill and understanding of object oriented programming. 

There are mainly two types of modules you can make, `action` and `occurrence`. Most of the time, you will want action modules.

Comprehensive instructions for creating modules are still in preparation. If you are interested, open the `include/class/module/action` folder and you'll see some built-in action modules. If you open some of the files, you'll notice that each of them are very short. What it does is basically extend a base module class like `TaskScheduler_Action_Base` and insert code in the methods predefined by the base class.

If you are comfortable reading PHP code, it should not be hard to figure out. Give it a try. If you get a question, don't hesitate to post a question about it.

= Found a bug. Where can I report? =
Please use the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/michaeluno/Task-Scheduler) of this plugin.

= How do I list my module? =
If you create a module plugin that can be shared by others, submit it to wordpress.org.
